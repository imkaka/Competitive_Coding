// Weighted Job Scheduling => It is the variation of Activity Selection Problem .(https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/Algorithms/Greedy/Activity_Selection.cpp)
// In this we have another factor in addition to Start Time and Finish Time.
//               * Profit/Weight associated
// So we have to find the non overlapping maximum Profit jobs.

// we can not solve this Problem via Greedy technique but it can we solved by Dynamic Programming.
// we will discuss DP solution to solve above Problem.

//Solution Idea:
/*         1. Sort the jobs according to Finish time
           2. Recursive Procedure:
                  maxProfit(jobs[],N):
                    a. if N==1:
                          return jobs[0]
                    b. Return max Of:
                            1. Maximum profit by excluding current job MaximumProfit(jobs[], N-1)
                            2. Maximum profit by including the current job.

          The idea is to find the latest job before the current job that doesn't conflict with current job 'arr[n-1]'.
          Once we find such a job, we recur for all jobs till that job and add profit of current job to result.

          The Above Recursive Solution result in Overlapping Subproblems and here the DP come 
          to evaluate a sub-problem only once and store in table and use it if required later.


  Example:              |Job|Start Time|Finish Time| Profit|
                        
                        |A  |     1    |    2      |  60   |
                        |B  |     3    |    6      |  90   |
                        |C  |     2    |    100    |  400  |

          Solution (Recursive): 
                               
                         {A,B}        =>  60+90 = 150
                      A/      
                       \{A}/ {A,C}    =>  60+400 = 460   <= Max Profit (Result)
                           \ {A}      =>  60
